This is a set of scripts to store[1], distribute[2] and manage[3] mail.

[1] Mail is stored on the server encrypted with gpg by the included MDA script gpgmda (tested on postfix).
[2] Mail is distributed to any number of clients (mail readers) via ssh/rsync.
[3] Mail is read, tagged, and replied to with alot. Standard end-to-end public key encryption and decrypton are supported. Alot is good stuff.

	notmuchmail: http://notmuchmail.org

	alot: https://github.com/pazz/alot

	gnupg: http://gnupg.org
